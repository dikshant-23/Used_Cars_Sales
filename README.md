## Domain: Retail

Context:The market for so-called second-hand cars is enormous. Many people think about buying a used car instead of a new one since it is more practical and a better investment. The primary cause of this enormous market is that when you purchase a new car and sell it the following day without experiencing any financial difficulties, the cost of the car drops by a lot.The pre-owned automobile market has continued to expand over the years and is currently larger than the new car market as new car sales have recently slowed down.
